    Apotherm
        |apo| The apothem (sometimes abbreviated as apo) of a regular polygon is a line segment from 
        the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. Equivalently, it is the line drawn 
        from the center of the hexagon that is perpendicular to one of its sides (edges). The 
        word "apothem" can also refer to the length of that line segment.
